## Objective

The goal is to explore the Titanic dataset, understand key patterns using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and build models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Visualizations of age, class, gender, and survival rates  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Insights into how features affect survival

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Filling missing values  
   - Label encoding / One-hot encoding  
   - Feature selection & scaling

3. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.  
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix

4. **Insights**  
   - Women and children had higher survival chances  
   - Passengers in 1st class had better survival odds  
   - Fare and age were important features

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo or download the project files.

2. Install required packages:
   (pip install -r requirements.txt)

3. Run the main pipeline:
   (python src/main.py)
   Or
   open the Jupyter notebook:
   (jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_model.ipynb)

## Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)
